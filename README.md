<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The game is pretty straight forward , is the classic tic-tac-toe we all know but there some kind of twists.
  <ul>
  <li>1. You can set a duration for the turns to make things more interesting </li>
    
  <li>2. You can also play against a bot. Be careful is not as easy as you think</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
  First of all you have to open 3 terminals ( 1 for server and 2 for the clients ).
  <p>You will start the server by giving the command ./TriServer "optional timeout in second" "symbol of the first player" "symbol of the second player"</p>

  <p align="center">./TriServer 10 X O</p>

  <p>Then for the remaining terminals you will give the command ./TriClient "YourName"</p>

   <p align="center">./TriClient pl1</p>

   <p align="center">./TriClient pl2</p>
